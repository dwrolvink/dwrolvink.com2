# Why making your own website is good for the internet
The reason behind leaving Facebook is that over the years, a couple of big companies have taken effective control over the internet, 
and with it, the flow of information.

This gives them immense control over the culture of the internet and thus humanity as a whole. The more we rely on the internet for 
our information, the more this handful of companies can control what we perceive reality to be. With the ever increasing developments
 in AI, this control over us will only become easier over time.

I was more hopeful in the beginning of web 2.0, but slowly it's starting to become clear that these companies are solidifying their 
grip over their platforms; Facebook and Youtube are actively banning and filtering posts/videos that don't agree with their view of 
right and wrong. (Take Facebook enforcing American prudishness and morals on the rest of the world, or Youtube's mental breakdown 
after the Adpocalypse).

I hear about creators being banned and/or harassed on Youtube, pages being banned on Facebook for silly little things. And always I 
think, "meh, it's not me", but the idea that someone can decide what I get to see, who I get to interact with, scares me.

Whether Facebook actively influenced elections is not proven, but trusting these companies to "not be evil"(TM), would be naive in 
any case, considering the power that they have. Give a man a tool, and he will use it.  
To think that they are "already too powerful and too mainstream to avoid" would be defeatist and only contributes to fortify that 
(depressing) idea.

It doesn't have to be this way. In the early days of the internet, people linked to each other's sites directly, created their own 
lists of sources of information, and used RSS feeds to aggregate information in central locations. It was more common for people to 
pay for their own hosting, and there was still a lot of freedom on free webpage hosting solutions like Geocities.

The normalcy of consuming predominantly free to use webservices is really at the root of why the internet has become a lot less free, 
and why those big companies have gotten so much power over the internet.

Aside from cultural influence, Facebook and Google collect massive amount of information about us. Both have recently been in privacy
 scandals, but even if that wouldn't happen, their regular use of that information is troublesome still.

The tame reaction to companies collecting so much information about us, in return for free services, because "they only use it to display
 personalized ads", really shows a misunderstanding of how effective ads are in changing our behavior for the worse.

You'd think that getting ads for what you want is better than getting random ads. But in reality, seeing things that you want but 
don't need — all the time — is a very effective way to make you unhappy. Not only will it make you spend a lot of money on useless 
things, it can also aggravate the 'paradox of choice'**. In short, being constantly barraged with things that you want but don't need
 will shift your focus away from the things that you need, and make you less content with the things you already have. 
The better the ads are tailored to us, the more effective they become at making us unhappy. (Even aside from the fact that a main 
strategy in advertisement is too create needs by making one unhappy/insecure).

Let's not discuss what other things all this information could be misused for when it comes in the wrong hands, I think this is 
pretty obvious, even if we don't (want) to think about it. And as said before, there is no reason to believe that it is in the "right hands" 
now at Google and Facebook.

Aside from the above rational, I'm also just very interested in learning more about website hosting, fringe solutions, and building my own 
presence on the internet.

So in the course of this year, I'm gonna try to set up my own online presence, including linked lists of things that I think are interesting
 and important (or just fun), and trying to find or build an RSS feed-like-solution to get people to share what they want to share more 
 directly with each other and the world, using their own webhosting or through a group-owned webhosting solution.
